-- Phases
- Hartstoria
Abandonded house of million and millions of species, including Ellies, #### and ####
once safe and warm now cold and deadly
- "underground"
It's cold surface hides the heat underneath, random heat waves may occur at any time
making it's stay fatal unprotected
- Trenches
A place deeper than deeper, unknown until the accident.
A place of pure fear and despair, little to noone survived the underground, less survived this
If you came here prepare to be blasted with a lot of heat and cold waves + intense heat waves
- Deeper than Deeper
Noone has made it this far and thus the information of this place is yet to be discovered, you WILL die here.
A group of Ellies was sent long ago without any returning, the name was given on honour of those fallen here

-- Items
- M.C.H.A.F.E or Mind Control Helper At Finding Experiments
This peculiar item connects the individual to a higher force usually does nothing on its own, it has an a way to deactivate but it should be the last thing you want to do as this will mostly result on inmediate disease on it's individual due to it's lack of brain stimuli

-- Species
- Elie, half-cat, quarter-human and half female (mostly lacks breasts but can reproduce)
due to its nature this specie is submessive by instict and even if their emotions aren't the brithest you can always turn their mood up with a little of compassion
this thing should not eat chocolate or derivates but it can get inmune quiclky to it if it consumes enough of it, this applies to everything
in difference from other species, if they're motivated by something they'll ignore anything else to comply with their order
this includes but its not limited to: Cannibalism, Skinning, Killing, Voring, Pain, Amputations,
Hurting, Violating, Dropping, Stealing, Drinking, Exhiving, Lying, Injecting, etc.
this makes this specie mentally unstable and thus anything they don't like will make them break emotionally
(getting something to not like them its extremely rare since they get adapted to pretty much everything but its still a possibility in rare cases of "TOO too much" in a short period of time)
